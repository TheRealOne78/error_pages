            you've been trolled<br>
            Yes, you've probably been told<br>
            Don't reply to this guy<br>
            He's just trying to get a rise<br>
            Out of you, yes, it's true<br>
            You respond and that's his cue<br>
            To start trouble on the double<br>
            While he strokes his manly stubble<br>
            <br>
            You've been trolled, you've been trolled<br>
            You should probably just fold<br>
            When the only winning move is not to play<br>
            And yet you keep on trying, mindlessly replying<br>
            You've been trolled, you've been trolled, have a nice day<br>

          <p>The <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> <span class="selected">418 I'm a teapot</span> client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014.</p>
