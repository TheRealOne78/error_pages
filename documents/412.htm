          <p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <span class="selected">412 Precondition Failed</span> client error response code indicates that access to the target resource has been denied. This happens with conditional requests on methods other than <span class="selected">GET</span> or <span class="selected">HEAD</span> when the condition defined by the <span class="selected">If-Unmodified-Since</span> or <span class="selected">If-None-Match</span> headers is not fulfilled. In that case, the request, usually an upload or a modification of a resource, cannot be made and this error response is sent back.<br>
